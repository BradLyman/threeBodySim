          The controlls are simple: Just click the mouse anywhere on the screen to
          change where the particle starts at!

        <p>
          When you get tired of watching an orbit, or when the particle leaves the screen, just click again
          to start a new orbit.

          If you are like me, you probably want to know what is happening here. If you're not like me,
          then you might just want to click the "back to the simulation" button as this will likely
          be outrageouly boring.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will start simple, this web-app is implemented with JavaScript and an awesome
          WebGL/creative-coding library
          called <a href="http://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>. Not much more to say about that, the code is
          easy enough to read and is available on
          <a href="https://github.com/BradLyman/threeBodySim">my github page</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are two things to focus on when we examine the simulation.
          First, we want to understand what we are simulating (e.g. the physics).
          And second we want to understand how we go about solving the equations that the physics provides us with.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subheader">The Physics</h3>
        <p>
          A three body gravitation system is just any system where there are 3 objects which are acting on
          each other gravitationally. Three body systems are interesting because they seem like they should be
          simple, but in reality they form a complex set of dynamical systems.
          Because of this complexity we choose to use a three body system where one of the bodies is so small
          that its influence on the overall system is insignificant. Choosing to model the system this way is
          usefull because we are left with what is essentially a two body system
          (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_two-body_problem">which is well understood</a>).
          From here forwards we will refer to our two large bodies as "planets" and the third insignificant
          body as a "particle".
        </p>

        <p>
          Two body gravitational systems have analytic solutions, so we can model the two planets without
          worrying about numeric differential equation solvers. However, the particle is a different story...
        </p>

        <p>
          When we build the equations describing the force on the particle we are left with a differential
          equation which has no analytic solution (TODO: actually show the math, and maybe a picture).
          This is where the business with diff. eqn. solvers comes in.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subheader">The Numerics</h3>
        <p>
          This is actually a really cool discussion to have, especially when we investigate the pros and cons of
          different differential equation solvers. But it's late and that discussion is likely out of the scope
          of my tired rambling. So instead I'll just say we solve for the particle's position with
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_methods_for_ordinary_differential_equations">magic</a>.
